Here is the list of commands I followed to enable the make.

1) First download Torvalds linux distribution and then make the new repository.
2) copy config from current distribution and "make menuconfig". select CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y 
3) sudo make clean 
4) sudo make -j2 
5) make modules
6) make modules_install
7) make install
8) make sure you run them all in sudo mode so you have permissions
